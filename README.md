##Overview
This D&D Character Generator is an application that simplifies the process of creating a unique character for the user to play within a Dungeons and Dragons TTRPG (Table-Top Role playing game). It utilizes a simple, step-by-step approach to helping the user build a basic character sheet within the D&D rule base by using official online databases (APIs) for D&D. This application was designed as a bare-bones introduction to character building by laying out the class, race and stats for the user to choose from and a completed character sheet with all the information the user has input and selected.

##Technologies Used
